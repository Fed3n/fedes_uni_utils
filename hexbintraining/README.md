# HEX/BIN CONVERSIONS TRAINING
Simple game I made when trying to learn VueJS. Could be expanded with high-scores, time, and so on...
If you are learning low level programming you should probably be comfortable in making binary/hexadecimal conversions so you could aswell give it a try. :))
Just run tutorial.html with your browser of choice.
